How to Implement the Method

1. Choose Your Material:

Select audio at your level or slightly above it. Beginner learners can start with slow and clear podcasts, while advanced learners might use movies, news, or native-speed recordings.
Set Up Your Tools:

2. Use a notebook or a digital tool for writing.

Audio playback software with pause, rewind, and slow-down features.
Start Listening and Writing:

3. Play a short segment of audio (e.g., 10–30 seconds).

Pause and write down exactly what you hear, even if it’s incomplete.
Rewind and listen again to fill gaps.
Check Your Work:

4. Compare your transcription with subtitles, transcripts, or answers, if available.

Highlight errors and identify patterns of misunderstanding.
Practice Regularly:

5. Dedicate time daily or weekly for consistent practice.

Gradually increase the difficulty of the material.
Combine with Other Skills:

6. Read the transcript aloud to practice pronunciation.

Review vocabulary or grammar points from the material.
